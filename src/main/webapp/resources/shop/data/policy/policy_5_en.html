			<dt>In what currency can I pay?</dt>
			<dd>
				Payment currencies can be made in euros, but they provide price information in the currency of your area to help convenience shopping.<br/>
				Some credit card companies and banks charge overseas payment fees because it is a payment on an overseas site.<br/>
				Therefore, we inform you in advance that the actual amount charged by the credit card company may differ from the amount paid on our site, and the additional fee is irrelevant to our Ritzmall.<br/>
				If you have any questions about overseas payment fees, exchange rates, etc., please contact the credit card company or bank directly.
